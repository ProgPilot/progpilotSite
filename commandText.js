In CTFs I'm in charge of forensics and\nI want to get into crypto, as well as reverse\nengineering. I enjoy programming in Python as\nwell as C++, currently reading up on neural\nnetworks as I want to experiment with machine\nlearning. Other hobbies include playing the\nguitar and writing, but these aren't as\nimportant as my passion for computing.
